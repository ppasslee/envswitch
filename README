===========================

This is a trivial script that gives the user the ability to quickly
source profiles of environment variables. This is particularly useful
for OpenStack, AWS and other IaaS providers which require various
environment variables in order to function with different accounts.

Project page:
  https://github.com/sitepoint/envswitch

Requirements:
* bash
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

Setup:
  Place the envswitch script somewhere in your path and ensure it has
  executable permissions configured. Next, in your ~/.bashrc file add
  the following line:

  eval "$(envswitch -i)"

Profile configuration:

  Upon first execution of envswitch, the directory
  ${HOME}/.config/envswitch will be created. Install environment
  variables into a file under this directory with a .conf extension. eg.

  somevar="test1"
  anothervar="${somevar}"
  numbervar=123

  Note the name of the configuration file (minus the .conf extension)
  should not match the name of an existing shell function. If in
  doubt, check the output of `declare -F`.

Usage:
  envswitch -l

  Lists any available profiles. These exist as local bash functions,
  which can be called any time just by typing the name. The shell
  prompt should be updated to reflect the loaded profile.

  envreset

  Clears all environment variables from the shell.
